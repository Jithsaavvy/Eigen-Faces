# Eigen-Faces and OpenCV
In this task, I developed code for my own facial recognition library using Eigen faces and OpenCV (i.e.) by using API or libraries and without any available APIs or libraries.

**Programming Language Used: Python**

Eigenfaces can be used in facial recognition, allowing to distinguish between different persons, but can also be applied to other use cases, such as voice or gesture recognition.

Note: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used here

Following to it, the face recognition task is also performed using inbuild library - OpenCV.
